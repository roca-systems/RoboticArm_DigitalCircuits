 * This is the Arduino code PAC6985 16 channel servo controller
 * watch the video for details (V1) and demo http://youtu.be/y8X9X10Tn1k
 *  This code is #1 for V2 Video Watch the video :https://youtu.be/bal2STaoQ1M
 *  I have got 3 codes as follow:
   #1-Arduino Code to run one by one all servos from 0 to 180Â°   
   #2-Arduino Code to control specific servos with specific angle
   #3-Arduino Code to run 2 or all servos at together

/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver
  Servo test - this will drive 16 servos, one after the other

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!
  ------> http://www.adafruit.com/products/815

  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to  
  interface. For Arduino UNOs, thats SCL -> Analog 5, SDA -> Analog 4

  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
